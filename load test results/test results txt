Question that need answering !

(1) How quickly can a single client with a ope open socket send data to Azure Using Long Polling ?

Answer: The fastest send rate I can record is 21 messages per second . 
	The client time was set to 10ms so in theory it should be sending 100 per second but the actual throughput was 20 per second.
	Assuming we set the client send frequency to 200ms expect to see 1 message per second ...


(1a) Wait a second that was using a browser right ? What about a mobile phone over 3G ??

At 100ms send rate my iPhone is clocking up 2 messages per second, at 200ms its clocking 1 message a second, at 10ms send rate it clock 15 messages per second

Assuming we set the client send frequency yo 200ms expect to see 1 message per second ...


(2) Cool , now tell me how far can I safely push a sinlge browser (lets look at both Chrome & IE ) with multiple conenctions over long polling? This will tell me
how far to push the browser when doing a load test. Lets set the send rate to 100ms.


Answer:

Internet Explorer 9 can only suport 2 concurrent connections (even when the client send rate is set to 500ms after that they just drop out !
Chrome 21 also drops after 2 connections, whats going on ???


15 clients with chrome but takes 500secs to get there
500 seconds




(3) When running with 25 connections(the max safe limit) how many messages per second can the client send ?

(4) How do you measure the time it takes to aggregate and total messages on the server, SImon metioned he did this already ?

(5) Run some load tests on Azure ramping up to say 500 users - how does the CPU / responsiveness change when you bring up and down 
the server send frequency

(6) What is the affect of running on a larger VM in azure - does it have bigger CPU's or just more, if its more there will be no difference


to do

- change dy on ball bounce 1 in the middle and 5 at the 5 top and bottom
- hit the wall before its before
