Findings

Using Long polling on Azure Websites 

(1) Chrome supports a max of 25 connections using websockets = after this it craps out
(2) VERY long delay ( 20 secs) beteen controller telling client to ramp up connections and any throughput on the server
(3) chunky responses coming through - maxing out at 6500 requests per 30 seconds , this is with 25 concurrent users sending data ar 40ms intervals...



To DO

X log number of users on the gamefield
X switch to websockets, period!
X trap dropped connections on the client
