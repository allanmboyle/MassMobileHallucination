Question that need answering !

(1) How quickly can a client with a single socket send data to Azure Using Long Polling ?

(2) How far can I safely push a sinlge browser (Chrome & IE ) with multiple conenctions over long polling ?

(3) When running with 25 connections(the max safe limit) how many messages per second can the client send ?

(4) How do you measure the time it takes to aggregate and total messages on the server, SImon metioned he did this already ?

(5) Run some load tests on Azure ramping up to say 500 users - how does the CPU / responsiveness change when you bring up and down 
the server send frequency

(6) What is the affect of running on a larger VM in azure - does it have bigger CPU's or just more, if its more there will be no difference
