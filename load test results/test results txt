Question that need answering !

(1) How quickly can a single client with an open socket send data to Azure Using Long Polling ?

Answer: The fastest send rate I can record is 21 messages per second . 
	The client time was set to 10ms so in theory it should be sending 100 per second but the actual throughput was 20 per second.
	Assuming we set the client send frequency to 200ms expect to see 1 message per second ...


(1a) Wait a second that was using a browser right ? What about a mobile phone over 3G ??

At 100ms send rate my iPhone is clocking up 2 messages per second, at 200ms its clocking 1 message a second, at 10ms send rate it clock 15 messages per second

Assuming we set the client send frequency yo 200ms expect to see 1 message per second ...

(2) Cool , now tell me how far can I safely push a single browser (look at both Chrome & IE ) with multiple conenctions over long polling? This will tell me
how far to push the browser when doing a load test. Lets set the send rate to 100ms.

Answer:

You can push IE and Chrome to 20 connections but it takes time (600seconds)  step up one at a time
Chrome 21 you can get 15 concurrent on my laptop (500 ms client send rate) but you need to ramp up slowlyit took 500 seconds to get to this!

IE9 can get up to 20 after 600 secs but the graph isnt as smooth as chrome - very spikey and some 10 second samples have no messages as it steps up 
got 22 connections comfortably sending at 300 m/s

IE 15 users - send rate 130 per second
chrome 15 users send rate - 150 messages per second

The send rate is pretty similar for chrome and IE but IE had a few 10 second intervals with no messages recieved..


(3) When running with 20 connections(the max safe limit) how many messages per second can the client send ?


(4) How do you measure the time it takes to aggregate and total messages on the server, SImon metioned he did this already ?


(5) Run some load tests on Azure ramping up to say 500 users - how does the CPU / responsiveness change when you bring up and down 
the server send frequency


(6) What is the affect of running on a larger VM in azure - does it have bigger CPU's or just more, if its more there will be no difference
